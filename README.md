# matlabPAC_process2P

MATLAB pipeline for processing two-photon calcium imaging data, from raw ScanImage `.tif` files through motion correction, neuropil subtraction, and cohort-level analysis.

## Analysis workflow

### 0. Ad hoc FRA map during experiment — `adhocFRAmap.m`

Run during or immediately after a recording session to get a quick best-frequency (BF) / frequency response area (FRA) map without running the full pipeline.

- Select the animal data directory and the tif files used for FRA mapping
- ROIs are drawn with `roiGUI` on the first map tif and reused for the rest
- Calls `FRAmap` to compute peak fluorescence responses across tone frequencies and amplitudes
- Plots FRA map and mean response curve via `plotFRAmap`
- Output saved to `adHocMap/` in the data directory

### 0b. Ad hoc trace inspection — `adhoc2P.m`

Quick look at average cell responses across a set of tifs without running the full pipeline.

- Requires ROIs drawn by `roiGUI` on the first selected tif
- Applies those ROIs to all selected tifs, computes dF/F per cell, and plots individual and population-mean traces

### 1. Per-animal processing — `processAnimal2P.m`

Full processing pipeline for a single animal session. Edit `dataPath` at the top and run section by section.

| Step | Section | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Tif inventory | List all tifs, assign pre/post treatment labels, flag FRA map tifs, save `_tifFileLegend.mat` |
| 2 | Condition split | Group tifs by treatment condition. **Auto-splits any group containing both 256×256 and 256×128 tifs by frame size** (reads each header) so every motion-correction group is dimensionally uniform; the full frame keeps the base name, crops get a `_<H>x<W>` suffix (e.g. `postZX1` + `postZX1_128x256`) |
| 3 | Motion correction | Optionally split multi-channel tifs to single-channel (channel 2); concatenate per group; run NoRMCorre non-rigid correction (params from data dims, so 256×128 corrects normally); write corrected tifs to `NoRMCorred/` for FISSA |
| 3b | Resume block | Uncomment `%{...%}` to reload motion-corrected data without re-running NoRMCorre (e.g. when drawing ROIs for a new cell type) |
| 4–5 | ROI drawing | Interactively draw ROIs on the motion-corrected stack via `TIFcatROIgui`; repeat for each **256×256** treatment condition; save per condition to `_moCorrROI_<condition>.mat` |
| 5b | ROI reuse (256×128) | **Auto, no manual lever:** detects any 256×128 condition by header and remaps the contained ROIs from the matching 256×256 condition's `_moCorrROI_` file via `remapROIfile` (centered crop, IDs preserved). No-op when no 256×128 condition exists. Errors if the geometry is not the expected zoom-matched centered crop |
| 6 | ROI matching | `intersectROIfiles` keeps only ROIs present in all conditions so the same cells are compared pre/post. **256×128 (spont) conditions are excluded** so they don't reduce the 256×256 stim ROI set |
| 7 | Raw F extraction | Extract rawF and motion-corrected rawF per ROI per tif (per condition, using that condition's ROI set); save to `_moCorr_Tifs_Params.mat` |
| 8 | FISSA (Python) | Run `FISSAviaMatlab_prePostTreatment.py` in a FISSA-enabled Python environment; output to `NoRMCorred/FISSAoutput/matlab.mat`. **FISSA requires a uniform ROI count per run**, so a session mixing 256×256 (full ROI set) and 256×128 (reduced set) needs a **separate FISSA pass per frame size** — see the 256×128 path below |
| 9 | FISSA parsing | Load FISSA output; split map vs. stimulus trials; apply neuropil scaling factor (`corrected = ROI − scale × neuropil`; default 0.8); save `_tifFileList.mat` |
| 10 | Stim alignment | `stimParam2ROI` attaches stimulus parameters from `_Pulses.mat` files to the corrected traces; **resolves the matching ROI set per stim group by trace row-count**, so a 256×128 spont group uses its reduced (remapped) ROI set |

**Output:** `tifFileList` struct where `tifFileList.stim(n).SCALEDfissaFroi` is an `nROI × nFrames` array of motion- and neuropil-corrected fluorescence for the nth stimulus tif. Equivalent `.map` field for FRA/BF mapping tifs.

### 1b. 256×128 (10 Hz spontaneous) reuse path

Spontaneous sessions can be acquired at **256×128, 10 Hz** (double the 5 Hz frame rate) by halving `linesPerFrame` to 128 with `scanAngleMultiplierSlow = 0.5` at the **same zoom** — a centered vertical crop of the 256×256 field (drops the top/bottom 64 rows, 1:1 pixels). ROIs drawn on the 256×256 data are reused on the 256×128 spont tifs; only cells fully contained in the central crop survive. **5 Hz and 10 Hz traces are never pooled** — the 256×128 data follows the **Spont** analysis path as its own family.

The path runs through `processAnimal2P.m` with **no manual intervention**, assuming the 256×256 and 256×128 tifs share a recording folder and a treatment token (so the crop condition pairs with its 256² source):

1. **§2** auto-splits the mixed treatment group into a 256² condition and a `_128x256` condition.
2. **§3** motion-corrects each independently (NoRMCorre takes dims from the data).
3. **§4–5** draw ROIs on the 256² condition only.
4. **§5b** auto-remaps those ROIs into the 256×128 condition (`remapROItoAcq` → centered crop; errors on any zoom/shift/rotation mismatch, e.g. an accidental zoom≠1).
5. **§6** matches ROIs across the 256² conditions only; the crop condition is excluded.
6. **§7** extracts F per condition using each condition's own ROI set (256² stim tifs → full set; 128 spont tifs → reduced set).
7. **§8 FISSA — run once per frame size.** Because FISSA's output is a fixed cells×trials grid, a single run cannot mix a 18-ROI and an 11-ROI set. Run FISSA separately for the 256² tifs and the 256×128 tifs (uniform ROI count within each), then parse each output. *(This per-frame-size invocation is the one step not yet automated in the Python driver — see Known limitations.)*
8. **§9** parses the FISSA output(s) and applies neuropil scaling.
9. **§10** `stimParam2ROI` builds the per-family tables. Its spont branch resolves the **256×128 ROI set** (by trace row-count) and produces `<animal>_anmlROI_SpontstimTable.mat`, whose `anmlROIbyStim` rows hold **10 Hz traces from the fixed (remapped) ROIs**, ready for further spontaneous-activity analysis.

**ROI-reuse helpers** (`helperFcns/ROI/`): `remapROItoAcq.m` (geometry-validated centered crop of a `moCorROI` struct; regenerates `mask` for raw-F and `ROIcurveOrderedXY` for FISSA, preserving IDs) and `remapROIfile.m` (driver: load source ROIs + read src/tgt tif headers + remap + save the pipeline bundle). Validated by `tests/testRemapROItoAcq_centeredCrop.m`.

**Known limitation:** §8 still requires running FISSA manually once per frame size for a mixed session; the Python driver does not yet loop per ROI-set.

### 2. Compile cohort data — `compileCohortData.m`

Aggregates per-animal outputs into a single cohort-level table. Edit the parameters block at the top.

- `compileAnmlFRA` — collects FRA maps and BF estimates across animals
- `compileAnmlROItables` — collects stimulus/response tables per animal
- Joins BF data into the response table; keeps only tone-responsive cells (`dPrime > 0`)
- Re-indexes animal and ROI IDs as sequential integers
- Saves `<cohortName>_dataTable.mat` and `<cohortName>_params.mat`

---

### 3. Plot cohort data — `plotCohortData.m`

Loads the compiled cohort table and produces analysis figures. Each analysis block is wrapped in `%{...%}` and run independently.

- Computes dF/F relative to DRC and pure-tone (PT) baseline windows
- Extracts peak dF/F responses at PT onset using `pkFcalc`
- Analyses include: PT response ratio vs. PT onset, sustained DRC response, pre/post treatment comparisons
- Statistical testing via `sigDiffCalc` (parametric or Wilcoxon) with permutation test fallback

---

### 4. Per-stimulus analyses — `stimulusSpecific/`

After step 10 above, `stimParam2ROI` writes one stim-aligned table per stimulus family (e.g. `<animal>_anmlROI_BPNstimTable_raw.mat`, `<animal>_anmlROI_CGCstimTable.mat`). Each script below loads its family's table, adds dF/F and peak metrics, and plots. Each resolves `dataPath` via `uigetdir` if not already in the workspace.

#### `processBPN2P.m` — band-pass noise (BPN), single animal

Two-stage: reads the `_raw` table from `stimParam2ROI`, writes the processed `<animal>_anmlROI_BPNstimTable.mat` (re-running overwrites the processed file but never the `_raw` input).

- Configurable pre-onset `baselineSec` (default 1 s); each row's dF/F is onset-normalized so stim onset lands at the same frame regardless of its recorded `BPNsOnset`
- `combineDiffOnset` merges same-stim / different-onset rows (onset-aligning the raw F cells too)
- Trial-averages dF/F per row (`dFF_avg`), then runs `pkFcalc` on the cell-average to get peak dF/F + significance
- Plots: single ROI × dB, single ROI all dB, population (between-cell SEM per dB), peak dF/F vs. dB

#### `processRLF.m` — rate/response-level function across a cohort

Pools the **processed** BPN tables from multiple animals into one rate-level analysis.

- Concatenates each animal's `anmlROIbyStim` (cells kept distinct by `animal`+`roiID`)
- Builds per-cell RLFs and dB thresholds via `tableRLF`; cells are included only with ≥ `nConsec` consecutive significant dB levels
- Plots the cohort-mean RLF (with per-cell traces) via `plotRLF`

#### `processCGC.m` — pure-tone-in-contrast (contrast gain control)

Single-stage; loads/saves `<animal>_anmlROI_CGCstimTable.mat`.

- dF/F referenced first to a pre-DRC baseline (`dFF_DRC`), then additively to a pre-pure-tone baseline (`dFF_PT`), matching the manuscript method
- Peak PT responses + significance from the **cell-average** trace (`dFF_PT_avg`), via `pkFcalc`
- Plots: per-ROI PT traces (3×3 grid), population average trace, and low-vs-high contrast peak dF/F scatter / bar comparison

#### `processFRA.m` — frequency response area mapping

Operates on `tifFileList` directly (not via a per-stim table); computes per-cell FRA maps and best-frequency estimates.
